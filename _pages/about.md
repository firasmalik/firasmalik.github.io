In a pursuit to make a positive contribution to the world, I have always felt excited to work for positions where one could mobilize the capabilities for growth and development. While working as a Risk Analyst at Amazon, I worked with Amazonâ€™s global customer base, which made me experience its impact on the people. Surrounded by the massive amount of data inspired me to gain more expertise in data science. Being ahead of my peers, I proactively joined as a Middlesex University Dubai Campus student in their flagship MSc. Data Science program. As a data science trainer at Kaplan, I contribute to Artificial Intelligence awareness by training students in a Bootcamp.I made a jekyll theme.
